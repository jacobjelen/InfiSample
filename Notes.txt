TO DO:

- filter values
    - slider: jumps around because the reading is noisy
        - only change the slider position if the new value is different more than X threshold
    - multitouch: sensitivity is decreasing the further it is from the reading PCB
        - add a mask that levels it. array the is added to the actual readings
        - loop over one array -> use the same index in the other -> add values    

- Minimize
    - remove bootstrap icon dependency
    - remove useless fonts

- Make infitex icon

- git
    - create NoFilter branch - no moving averages or anything, just straight values
    - master branch is the one with 'production' code - for clients
        - mac
        - win 
        - ...branches for each electron app distribution
